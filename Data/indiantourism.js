However, in accordance with the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, Hyderabad was to remain as the de jure capital of both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states for a period of time not exceeding ten years. The new riverfront de facto capital, Amaravati, is under the jurisdiction of the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA).Andhra Pradesh has a coastline of 974 km (605 mi) – the second longest coastline among the states of India, after Gujarat – with jurisdiction over almost 15,000 km2 of territorial waters. The state is bordered by Telangana in the north-west, Chhattisgarh and Odisha in the north-east, Karnataka in the west, Tamil Nadu in the south, and to the east lies the Bay of Bengal. The small enclave of Yanam, a district of Puducherry, lies to the south of Kakinada in the Godavari delta on the eastern side of the state.The state is made up of the two major regions of Rayalaseema, in the inland southwestern part of the state, and Coastal Andhra to the east and northeast, bordering the Bay of Bengal.

            "History":" Andhra Pradesh is said to have been the home of the Pre- Dravidian inhabitants. Andhra region witnessed the rule of Chandragupta Maurya during which it established itself as an independent kingdom.After Ashoka, the Mauryan empire declined giving opportunity to establish smaller kingdoms. In about the third century BC the Satavahanas ruled for about five centuries. The Satavahanas established a strong rule with their territories extending upto Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The Satavahanas were overpowered by the Ikshvakus by the third century AD. During this period Brahmanism is said to have been revived. This reduced the influence of the Buddhist which was fostered by the Satavahanas.",

            "Description":"Arunachal Pradesh located in north eastern India has fifteen districts and is called 'Land of the Rising Sun'. The literary meaning of the 'Land of the Rising Sun' is 'the land of the dawn lit mountains.' The state has its capital in Itanagar, which is also its largest city. The state, known for its natural beauty is backed by a strong agricultural economy- pulses, sugarcane, rice, wheat, maize being its main crops. It has a considerable amount of forest cover which ensures that the forest products also contribute to its economy. The tourism sector of the state, however, has not been fully utilized.",
            "History":" The history of pre-modern Arunachal Pradesh is unclear. According to the Arunachal Pradesh government, the Hindu texts Mahabharata mention the region as the Prabhu Mountains of the Puranas, and where sage Parashurama washed away sins, the sage Vyasa meditated, King Bhishmaka founded his kingdom, and Lord Krishna married his consort Rukmini. On the other hand, the Kalika Purana written in the 10th century mentions the region to be ruled by the descendants of a king named Bhirmuko of the Chutika (today's Chutia) clan.Recorded history only became available in the Chutiya chronicles. The Monpa and Sherdukpen do keep historical records of the existence of local chiefdoms in the northwest as well. Northwestern parts of this area came under the control of the Monpa kingdom of Monyul, which flourished between 500 B.C. and 600 A.D. The remaining parts of the state, especially those bordering Myanmar, were under the control of the Chutiya Kings. However, most Arunachali tribes remained in practice largely autonomous up until Indian independence and the formalisation of indigenous administration in 1947.Recent excavations of ruins of Hindu temples, such as the 14th century Malinithan at the foot of the Siang hills in West Siang, indicate they were built during the Chutiya reign. Another notable heritage site, Bhismaknagar (built in 8th century), has led to suggestions that the Chutiya people had an advanced culture and administration in prehistoric times. The third heritage site, the 400-year-old Tawang Monastery in the extreme north-west of the state, provides some historical evidence of the Buddhist tribal people. The sixth Dalai Lama Tsangyang Gyatso was born in Tawang.",
            "fairsfestivals":" Fairs and festivals in Arunachal Pradesh are a fine way to understand the state's rich culture and traditional practices.

            "Description":"Kerala, a state situated on the tropical Malabar Coast of southwestern India, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic Traveler, Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful backwaters. Its unique culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demography, have made Kerala one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Growing at a rate of 13.31%, the tourism industry is a major contributor to the state's economy.Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination, with most tourism circuits concentrated around the north of the country. Aggressive marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation—the government agency that oversees tourism prospects of the state—laid the foundation for the growth of the tourism industry. In the decades that followed, Kerala Tourism was able to transform itself into one of the niche holiday destinations in India. The tag line Kerala – God's Own Country was adopted in its tourism promotions and became a global superbrand. Kerala is regarded as one of the destinations with the highest brand recall. In 2010, Kerala attracted 660,000 foreign tourist arrivals.",
            "History":"The history of Kerala, India, dates back many millennia. Stone Age carvings in the Edakkal Caves feature pictorial writings believed to date to at least the Neolithic era around 5,000 BC, indicating the presence of a prehistoric civilisation or settlement in this region. From as early as 3000 BC, Chera nadu, currently known as Kerala had established itself as a major spice trade centre. Keralam, the then Chera nadu had direct contact across the Arabian Sea with all the major Mediterranean and Red Sea ports as well those of the Far East. The spice trade between Kerala and much of the world was one of the main drivers of the world economy.

            "History":"Tamil Nadu has a very ancient history that dates back to some 6000 years and the origin of its people is closely tied to the debates of the Aryan invasion theory. Those who uphold this theory favour the view that the Tamils belong to the Dravidian race and were part of the early Indus Valley settlers. Later with the advent of the Aryans, the Dravidians were pushed back into the deep south where they ultimately settled. The present day states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh constitute the Dravidian culture. Whatever be the historical truth, the identity of the Tamils has largely been forged on this ground. Madurai Meenakshi TempleThe Dravida Nadu of which modern Tamil Nadu formed a part was constituted by various kingdoms such as that of the Pallava, the Chera, the Chola, the Pandya, the Chalukya and the Vijayanagara.The history of Pandyan kingdom dates as early as 6th Century B.C. Madurai was founded by the first Pandyan king Kulasekara.The Pandyas excelled in trade and learning. They controlled the present districts of Madurai and Tirunelveli and part of South Kerala. The Pandyas had trading contacts with Greece and Rome and were powerful in their own right, though they were subjugated during various periods by the Pallavas and Cholas",

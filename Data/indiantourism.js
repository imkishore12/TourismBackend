The new riverfront de facto capital, Amaravati, is under the jurisdiction of the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA).Andhra Pradesh has a coastline of 974 km (605 mi) – the second longest coastline among the states of India, after Gujarat – with jurisdiction over almost 15,000 km2 of territorial waters.

            "History":" Andhra Pradesh is said to have been the home of the Pre- Dravidian inhabitants. Andhra region witnessed the rule of Chandragupta Maurya during which it established itself as an independent kingdom.After Ashoka, the Mauryan empire declined giving opportunity to establish smaller kingdoms. In about the third century BC the Satavahanas ruled for about five centuries. The Satavahanas established a strong rule with their territories extending upto Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The Satavahanas were overpowered by the Ikshvakus by the third century AD. During this period Brahmanism is said to have been revived. This reduced the influence of the Buddhist which was fostered by the Satavahanas.",

            "Description":"Arunachal Pradesh located in north eastern India has fifteen districts and is called 'Land of the Rising Sun'. The literary meaning of the 'Land of the Rising Sun' is 'the land of the dawn lit mountains.' The state has its capital in Itanagar, which is also its largest city. The state, known for its natural beauty is backed by a strong agricultural economy- pulses, sugarcane, rice, wheat, maize being its main crops. It has a considerable amount of forest cover which ensures that the forest products also contribute to its economy. The tourism sector of the state, however, has not been fully utilized.",
            "History":" The history of pre-modern Arunachal Pradesh is unclear. According to the Arunachal Pradesh government, the Hindu texts Mahabharata mention the region as the Prabhu Mountains of the Puranas, and where sage Parashurama washed away sins, the sage Vyasa meditated, King Bhishmaka founded his kingdom, and Lord Krishna married his consort Rukmini. On the other hand, the Kalika Purana written in the 10th century mentions the region to be ruled by the descendants of a king named Bhirmuko of the Chutika (today's Chutia) clan.Recorded history only became available in the Chutiya chronicles. The Monpa and Sherdukpen do keep historical records of the existence of local chiefdoms in the northwest as well. Northwestern parts of this area came under the control of the Monpa kingdom of Monyul, which flourished between 500 B.C. and 600 A.D. The remaining parts of the state, especially those bordering Myanmar, were under the control of the Chutiya Kings. However, most Arunachali tribes remained in practice largely autonomous up until Indian independence and the formalisation of indigenous administration in 1947.Recent excavations of ruins of Hindu temples, such as the 14th century Malinithan at the foot of the Siang hills in West Siang, indicate they were built during the Chutiya reign. Another notable heritage site, Bhismaknagar (built in 8th century), has led to suggestions that the Chutiya people had an advanced culture and administration in prehistoric times. The third heritage site, the 400-year-old Tawang Monastery in the extreme north-west of the state, provides some historical evidence of the Buddhist tribal people. The sixth Dalai Lama Tsangyang Gyatso was born in Tawang.",
